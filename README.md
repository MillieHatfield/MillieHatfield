### About me
My love for technology started when I got a LEGO Mindstorms kit at age 10 — and I’ve been hooked ever since! From building robots and coding in Scratch to experimenting with Blender, SketchUp, and Figma, I’ve always loved creating things that mix design and tech. Along the way, I’ve spoken at events, joined computer science competitions, and I’m now aiming for work experience at CERN. I’m currently working toward a work experience placement at CERN and building my portfolio to pursue a degree in Electronic Engineering.
